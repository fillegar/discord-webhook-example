Discord Webhooks are a method for getting data posted as a message to a text channel in a Discord server.  In simple words, you can think of Discord webhooks as an event listening system.  When a message is posted that is an event.  For example, suppose you have ordered a pizza and are waiting for the pizza to get delivered. Rather than calling the pizza place multiple times and asking whether the pizza is ready, similar to polling, you can think of a webhook as a notification system that will give you a call as soon as the pizza is ready and on the way.
